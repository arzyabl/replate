# RePlate  

RePlate is a food-sharing platform designed to reduce food waste and fight food insecurity by connecting people with surplus food to those who need it. The goal: make community-driven food exchange easy, safe, and stigma-free.  

## Why It Matters
**40%** of food in the US is wasted while **13.5%** of households face food insecurity. RePlate helps redirect surplus food directly to those who need it, making fresh, nutritious items more accessible. By enabling local sharing and tracking safety, the platform strengthens communities and encourages responsible consumption.

**Core Features:**  
- **Listing & Claiming:** Users can post available food, specify quantity, location, and images, and others can claim what they need.  
- **Requesting & Offering:** Users can request items they lack and others can fulfill those requests.  
- **Expiration Tracking:** Items can be time-limited to ensure food safety and reduce spoilage.  
- **Labeling & Filtering:** Items can be organized by categories to make searching easier.  
- **Reviews & Reporting:** Users can rate each other and report misuse to build trust and accountability.
